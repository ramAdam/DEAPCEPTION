Building Blocks of optimisation problems:

1: Household tranformation (Nealder and Mead Algorithms)
2: Rotation of the cordinate system (in variable metric Algorithms,
   such as covariance matrix adaptation, to acheieve seprabitlity,
   and allow for parallel computation)
3: Automatic differentiation (computing derivatives of algorithimically
   defined function, thus applying methods of smooth optimisation to 
   non smooth funcitons)


Stochastic local search methods

1: Simulated Annealing
2: Tabu search
3: Iterated local search
4: Evolutionary Algorithms
5: Ant colony optimisation


Stochastic search behaviour

1: Empirical evaluation
2: Search space charachteristics
3: Parmeterisation and tuning 

Applications:

1: SAT
2: Traverling salesman problem
3: Quadratic assignment problem
4: Schedualing
5: Planning 
6: Combinatorial problems

My Combinatorial Problems:

1: Elliot waves
2: Automaticaly learning the structure of a huge code base
3: Optimal diet


1: -4 < x < -2.5
    -18/-4 = 6
    -5/-2.5 = 2

2: -2.5 < x < -1 [-2.4, -1.1]
    -5\-2.5 =  2 
    -1\-3 = 0.333

3: 2 < x < 4
    -8\2.5 = -3.2
    -12\2.9 = -4.1
